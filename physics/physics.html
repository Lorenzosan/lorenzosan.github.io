    <h1>Physics</h1>
    <p>In this webpage I share some general information about the LHC, the ATLAS experiment and what I do as a PhD student within the ATLAS collaboration.</p>
    <p>I plan to expand this section to include some notes on the physics topics I enjoyed during my career as student at the University of Milan (UNIMI).</p>
