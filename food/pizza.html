  <title>My personal take on pizza places</title>
  </head>
  
  <body>
     <p> In this space I share my experiences in pizza places in the Geneva area, or anywhere else I go. With pizza places I mean both restraurant and take-away. </p>
     <p> The restaurants are sorted by their increasing zip code, starting from 1200. </p>

            <h2> Review: </h2> I had pizza here once with take away. I took a large Pepperoni. It was fine, but nothing special. The dough and the topping were ok, but I did not like the tomato sauce, it was weird.
            The price point of any pizza here is high (my large Pepperoni was 32.-), overall I would not suggest to stop here.

            This place was used to be run by italians until sometimes in early summer 2023, the pizza was very good at the times. However after the change in management, the quality of the pizza dropped. I went there a couple of times. Once for a Margherita, that was very plain. I would say that the dough missed a bit of salt.
            The second time I gave a chance to this place, I took a pepperoni pizza. Well .. the pizza maker cooked a Margherita and topped it at the end. I was looking unwilling to believe my eyes, and he said very proudly <em> .. this is how I make pizza ..</em>.
            What happened is incredible, and the pizza obviously was not good like the previous Margherita. Prices are unjustifiably always above 10.- for any take away pizza. I suggest you to NOT buy pizza in this place until it changes the pizza maker, or management.

              Beware, they have italian colors in their logo, but they are not italians. Pizza dough is prepared without enough salt.
              If we really want to find a good thing about this place, it is that with 10.- you can have your take away pizza with a can of the soft drink you like (valid in 2022).

                 This place is known to be one of the best pizza places in Geneva. I have my doubts about this. Pizza here is plain, like you can find it in many other places but it will cost you 2x or 3x more.
                 Kytaly is located in Geneva downtown, therefore it should not be difficult to do a little walk and find another place. I am sure there are way better restaurants than this one.

               Ok.. This is my favorite pizza place is the area. It's super-good, you should really try once. I am maybe biased, but I strongly suggest pepperoni pizza. The rate is not maximum because this place is only for take-away.
               The delivery does not come for free. In order to have free-of-charge delivery, they ask you to include in the order order a large pizza (40 cm diameter). Large pizzas are more expensive, but usually can easily feed two normal human beings.
               The prices of any pizza start from 12 Swiss Francs.

                Another restaurant of the Luigia chain. They have a nice garden adjacent to the restaurant, where they grow their own vegetables. Pizza here is OK, but it's not memorable.
                Prices are very high here (OK, Geneva prices), and I feel that for what you get they are not justified. Just FYI, here they make pasta carbonara with cream.

                This is one of the biggest pizzas you can find in Geneva. The diameter is between 35 cm and 40 cm. Pizza is good, but not extraordinary I would say. I had it twice, and both times was good, but also particularly salty.
                I don't know .. it could deserve another chance. Prices for a take-away pizza start from 16.- of a Margherita (early 2022).

                Chez Renato is run by italians, coming from Sicily. I would advice anyone in the area to try their pizza (not worth maybe to go there from Geneva city tho). I have very good memories about it. However, I don't remember their prices.

              This place is a food truck, and you can only have take-away pizza. There is only one person working here, therefore during dinner time, especially in the weekends, you might have to wait a bit more than normal. Said that, the pizza here is not great at all. The thickness, crust and cooking are fine, but the dough is missing salt. The toppings don't look very high quality, and they're extra seasoned, which is preventing you to actually taste them.
              However I still feel this Domino is better enough compared to the more famous chain. Prices are lower than average, being in France. Be careful that only cash is accepted.

        <p> Oh my god. I took here a Pepperoni pizza, and indeed it was a Pepperoni pizza but topped with A TON of onion. Why did you do that? Dough was not special, and tomato sauce as well.
          On the Google maps page they have a pizza with Balsamic vinegar sauce on it .. I felt a shudder of dread. I don't remember prices precisely, but the Pepperoni probably was around 12 Euro; too much.

        <p> Place run by italians. Pizza is meh, but given the outlook of other italian restaurants in the area, this is definitely still acceptable. I had a pepperoni pizza and it was good enough, but it can't be more than a 6/10.

        <p> Not an extremely good looking restaurant, but sometimes appearances can be deceptive. Pizza here is awesome, and very big! Calzone is very good, Margherita is very good, as well Pepperoni. If you are an hardcore pizza lover there is the <em>Spaccanapoli</em> pizza.
          It's a white pizza with sausage and friarielli, with the crust stuffed with cheese. Alert: take your time, it's very difficult to finish this pizza. 
          Prices are good, this is not an expensive place. </p>
