  <title>My personal take on pizza places</title>
  </head>
  
  <body>
     <p> In this space I share my experiences in pizza places in the Geneva area, or anywhere else I go. With pizza places I mean both restraurant and take-away. </p>
     <p> The restaurants are sorted by their increasing zip code, starting from 1200. </p>  
    
     <h1> Geneva area </h1>
        <p> <h2>10' dieci </h2> Address: Rue de la Servette 16, 1201 Geneva. </p>

            <h2>Rate: 6.5/10 </h2> 
          </p>
          <p>
            <h2> Review: </h2> I had pizza here once with take away. I took a large Pepperoni. It was fine, but nothing special. The dough and the topping were ok, but I did not like the tomato sauce, it was weird.
            The price point of any pizza here is high (my large Pepperoni was 32.-), overall I would not suggest to stop here.

        <p> <h2> Il Marinaio</h2>Rate: 5/10. Address: Rte de Meyrin 8, 1202 Geneva. </p>
        <p> This place was used to be run by italians until sometimes in early summer 2023, the pizza was very good at the times. However after the change in management, the quality of the pizza dropped. I went there a couple of times. Once for a Margherita, that was very plain. I would say that the dough missed a bit of salt.
            The second time I gave a chance to this place, I took a pepperoni pizza. Well .. the pizza maker cooked a Margherita and topped it at the end. I was looking unwilling to believe my eyes, and he said very proudly <em> .. this is how I make pizza ..</em>.
            What happened is incredible, and the pizza obviously was not good like the previous Margherita. Prices are unjustifiably always above 10.- for any take away pizza. I suggest you to NOT buy pizza in this place until it changes the pizza maker, or management. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> <h2> Chez Remo</h2>Rate: 3/10. Address: Rue des Buis 1, 1202 Geneva. </p>
        <p> Pizza here is awful, the dough is completely without salt and not well cooked. They sell themselves as italians, but they aren't! Don't go here to waste your money please. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> <h2> Cafe' Salento</h2>Rate: 8/10. Address: Rue du Vicaire-Savoyard 2, 1203 Geneva. </p>
        <p> Cafe' Salento is run by very friendly italians, originally coming from the Salento area in Apulia. Pizza here is very good, there is not that much to say. Prices are always above 10.- for take-away, but it's really worth.
            I would only remark that this place closes at 9 pm. It would be nicer if accessible also for longer in the evening, but ok.. it is understandable because they open at 7 am every day (Sunday closed). </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> <h2> Pizzamania </h2>Rate: 5/10. Address: Rue du Beulet 5, 1203 Geneva. </p>
        <p> Beware, they have italian colors in their logo, but they are not italians. Pizza dough is prepared without enough salt.
            Nevertheless the rate is not very low, because with 10.- you can have your take away pizza with a can of the soft drink you like (valid in 2022). </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> <h2> Domino's Pizza</h2>Rate: 5/10. Address: Av. Wendt 1, 1203 Geneva. </p>
        <p> Pizza here is overpriced, but still edible. It is stll better than some places you might end up in Geneva, and sometimes there are promotions.</p>
        <p></p> 
        <p> <h2>Giardino Romano</h2>Rate: 7.5/10. Address: Rue de Saint-Jean 30A, 1203 Geneva. </p>
        <p> Giardino Romano is owned by italians. It's a cute restaurant, and the pizza is very good. The rate is lowered half point because this place is expensive (OK, Geneva price .. but still). </p>
        <p></p>  
        <p></p> 
        <p> <h2>Les Tilleuls</h2>Rate: 8.5/10. Address:Av. des Tilleuls 2, 1203 Genève. </p>
        <p> This is an italian restaurant, which is not run by italians. However, all the food here is VERY good, and pizza too. If you are around, this is a place you should visit 100%. Prices are comparable with other restaurants in Geneva.</p>

        <p></p>    
        <p> <h2>Kytaly</h2>Rate: 6/10. Address: Bd Georges-Favon 12, 1204 Geneva. </p>
        <p> This place is known to be one of the best pizza places in Geneva. I have my doubts about this. Pizza here is plain, like you can find it in many other places but it will cost you 2x or 3x more.
            Kytaly is located in Geneva downtown, therefore it should not be difficult to do a little walk and find another place. I am sure there are way better restaurants than this one.
        </p>
        <p></p>    
        <p> <h2>Ristorante Pizzeria La Vecchia Napoli</h2>Rate: 8/10. Address: Bd Carl-Vogt 11, 1205 Geneva. </p>
        <p> Pizza here is very good. Nothing much more to add. I would say that there are in general generous portions, which most of the times is a nice plus. Prices are justified. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>    
        <p> <h2>Chez Marino</h2>Rate: 8/10. Address: Rue Muzy 22, 1207 Genève. </p>
        <p> This is a well-known place in the Eaux-Vives neighborhood run by italians, pizza is very good here! Prices are not on the low end, however they are justified. Big plus for the funny waiters! </p>
        <center><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2761.3677814157763!2d6.15442977631457!3d46.20313827109559!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x478c65313707c44f%3A0x3313f776cd502764!2sChez%20Marino!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sch!4v1713782694841!5m2!1sen!2sch" width="600" height="450" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe></center>
        <p></p>
        <p> <h2>Luigia Rive Droite</h2>Rate: 7/10. Address: Chem. de la Tourelle 2, 1209 Geneva. </p>
        <p> Luigia is part of a chain of restaurants, which are more or less all the same. Pizza is OK, without guts and without glory. Prices are high. </p>
        <p></p>     
        <p> <h2>Pizzeria Ristorante Molino</h2>Rate: 6/10. Address: Avenue Louis-Casaï 27, Case Postale 2903, 1211 Geneva. </p>
        <p> This place is located inside Balexert, just right before the theater. The menu is poor, you don't have much choice, and prices are crazy high. The pizza is OK, although I am personally not a fan of a soft crust. </p>
        <p></p>  
        <p> <h2>Da Vinci</h2>Rate: 9/10. Address: Rte du Mandement 15, 1217 Meyrin. </p>
        <p> Ok.. This is my favorite pizza place is the area. It's super-good, you should really try once. I am maybe biased, but I strongly suggest pepperoni pizza. The rate is not maximum because this place is only for take-away.
            The delivery does not come for free. In order to have free-of-charge delivery, they ask you to include in the order order a large pizza (40 cm diameter). Large pizzas are more expensive, but usually can easily feed two normal human beings.
            The prices of any pizza start from 12 Swiss Francs. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> <h2>Luigia Academy</h2>Rate: 7/10. Address: The Hive, 1217 Meyrin. </p>
        <p> Another restaurant of the Luigia chain. They have a nice garden adjacent to the restaurant, where they grow their own vegetables. Pizza here is OK, but it's not memorable.
          Prices are very high here (OK, Geneva prices), and I feel that for what you get they are not justified.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> <h2>Pizzeria Calabria - 3 Fratelli Scalea</h2> Rate: 7/10. Address: Quai du Cheval-Blanc 23, 1227 Geneva. </p>  
        <p> This is one of the biggest pizzas you can find in Geneva. The diameter is between 35 cm and 40 cm. Pizza is good, but not extraordinary I would say. I had it twice, and both times was good, but also particularly salty.
            I don't know .. it could deserve another chance. Prices for a take-away pizza start from 16.- of a Margherita (early 2022). </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> <h2>Chez Renato</h2>Rate: 8/10. Address: Rte de Saint-Julien 282, 1258 Perly-Certoux. </p>
        <p> Chez Renato is run by italians, coming from Sicily. I would advice anyone in the area to try their pizza (not worth maybe to go there from Geneva city tho). I have very good memories about it. However, I don't remember their prices. </p>
        <p></p>

     <h1> Heidelberg area </h1>
        <p> <h2>Stuzzico</h2>Rate: 4/10. Address: Kettengasse 1, 69117 Heidelberg. </p>
        <p> Oh my god. I took here a Pepperoni pizza, and indeed it was a Pepperoni pizza but topped with A TON of onion. Why did you do that? Dough was not special, and tomato sauce as well.
          On the Google maps page they have a pizza with Balsamic vinegar sauce on it .. I felt a shudder of dread. I don't remember prices precisely, but the Pepperoni probably was around 12 Euro; too much.
        </p>
        <p></p>  

     <h1> Hamburg area </h1>
        <p> <h2>Pizzeria Piceno</h2>Rate: 6/10. Address: Hein-Hoyer-Straße 8, 20359 Hamburg. </p>
        <p> Place run by italians. Pizza is meh, but given the outlook of other italian restaurants in the area, this is definitely still acceptable. I had a pepperoni pizza and it was good enough, but it can't be more than a 6/10.
        </p>
        <p></p>  
    
     <h1> Milan area </h1>
        <p> <h2>La Terrazza</h2>Rate: 8/10. Address: Via L. Tolstoi, 79, 20098 San Giuliano Milanese. </p>
        <p> Not an extremely good looking restaurant, but sometimes appearances can be deceptive. Pizza here is awesome, and very big! Calzone is very good, Margherita is very good, as well Pepperoni. If you are an hardcore pizza lover there is the <em>Spaccanapoli</em> pizza.
          It's a white pizza with sausage and friarielli, with the crust stuffed with cheese. Alert: take your time, it's very difficult to finish this pizza. 
          Prices are good, this is not an expensive place. </p>
