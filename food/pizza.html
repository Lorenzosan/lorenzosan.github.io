  <title>My personal take on pizza places</title>

     <p> In this space I share my experiences in pizza places in the Geneva area, or anywhere else I go. With pizza places I mean both restraurant and take-away. </p>
     <p> The order of appearance of the elements is random. </p>  
    
     <h2> Geneva area </h2>
        <p> <h1> Il Marinaio</h1>, 5/10. Rte de Meyrin 8, 1202 Geneva. </p>
        <p> This place was used to be run by italians until sometimes in early summer 2023, the pizza was very good at the times. However after the change in management, the quality of the pizza dropped. I went there a couple of times. Once for a Margherita, that was very plain. I would say that the dough missed a bit of salt.
        <p> The second time I gave a chance to this place, I took a pepperoni pizza. Well .. the pizza maker cooked a Margherita and topped it at the end. I was looking unwilling to believe my eyes, and he said very proudly <em> .. this is how I make pizza ..</em>. </p>
        <p> What happened is incredible, and the pizza obviously was not good like the previous Margherita. Prices are unjustifiably always above 10.- for any take away pizza. I suggest you to NOT buy pizza in this place until this place change pizza maker, or management. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> <h1> Cafe' Salento</h1>, 8/10. Rue du Vicaire-Savoyard 2, 1203 Geneva </p>
        <p> Cafe' Salento is run by very friendly italians, originally coming from the Salento area in Apulia. Pizza here is very good, there is not that much to say. Prices are always above 10.- for take-away, but it's really worth.</p>
        <p> I would only remark that this place closes at 9 pm. It would be nicer if accessible also for longer in the evening, but ok.. it is understandable because they open at 7 am every day (Sunday closed).
