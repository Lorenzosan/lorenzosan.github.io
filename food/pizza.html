  <title>My personal take on pizza places</title>
  </head>
  
  <body>
     <p> In this space I share my experiences in pizza places in the Geneva area, or anywhere else I go. With pizza places I mean both restraurant and take-away. </p>
     <p> The order of appearance of the elements is random. No, maybe they're sorted by the zip code. </p>  
    
     <h1> Geneva area </h1>
        <p> <h2> Il Marinaio</h2>Rate: 5/10. Address: Rte de Meyrin 8, 1202 Geneva. </p>
        <p> This place was used to be run by italians until sometimes in early summer 2023, the pizza was very good at the times. However after the change in management, the quality of the pizza dropped. I went there a couple of times. Once for a Margherita, that was very plain. I would say that the dough missed a bit of salt.
        <p> The second time I gave a chance to this place, I took a pepperoni pizza. Well .. the pizza maker cooked a Margherita and topped it at the end. I was looking unwilling to believe my eyes, and he said very proudly <em> .. this is how I make pizza ..</em>. </p>
        <p> What happened is incredible, and the pizza obviously was not good like the previous Margherita. Prices are unjustifiably always above 10.- for any take away pizza. I suggest you to NOT buy pizza in this place until this place change pizza maker, or management. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> <h2> Chez Remo</h2>Rate: 3/10. Address: Rue des Buis 1, 1202 Geneva. </p>
        <p> Pizza here is awful, the dough is completely without salt and not well cooked. They sell themselves as italians, but they aren't! Don't go here to waste your money please.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p> <h2> Cafe' Salento</h2>Rate: 8/10. Address: Rue du Vicaire-Savoyard 2, 1203 Geneva. </p>
        <p> Cafe' Salento is run by very friendly italians, originally coming from the Salento area in Apulia. Pizza here is very good, there is not that much to say. Prices are always above 10.- for take-away, but it's really worth.</p>
        <p> I would only remark that this place closes at 9 pm. It would be nicer if accessible also for longer in the evening, but ok.. it is understandable because they open at 7 am every day (Sunday closed).
        <p></p>
        <p> <h2> Pizzamania </h2>Rate: 5/10. Address: Rue du Beulet 5, 1203 Geneva. </p>
        <p> Beware, they have italian colors in their logo, but they are not italians. Pizza dough is prepared without enough salt. Nevertheless the rate is not very low, because with 10.- you can have your take away pizza with a can of the soft drink you like (valid in 2022).</p>
        <p></p>
        <p> <h2> Domino's Pizza</h2>Rate: 6/10. Address: Av. Wendt 1, 1203 Geneva. </p>
        <p> Pizza here is overpriced, but still edible. It is stll better than some places you might end up in Geneva, and sometimes there are promotions.</p>
        <p></p> 
        <p> <h2>Giardino Romano</h2>Rate: 7.5/10. Address: Rue de Saint-Jean 30A, 1203 Geneva. </p>
        <p> Giardino Romano is owned by italians. It's a cute restaurant, and the pizza is very good. The rate is lowered half point because this place is expensive (OK, Geneva price .. but still). </p>
        <p></p>  
        <p> <h2>Da Vinci</h2>Rate: 9/10. Address: Rte du Mandement 15, 1217 Meyrin. </p>
        <p> Ok.. This is my favorite pizza place is the area. It's super-good, you should really try once. I am maybe biased, but I strongly suggest pepperoni pizza. The rate is not maximum because this place is only for take-away. </p>
        <p> The delivery does not come for free. In order to have free-of-charge delivery, they ask you to include in the order order a large pizza (40 cm diameter). Large pizzas are more expensive, but usually can easily feed two normal human beings.</p>
        <p> The prices of any pizza starts from 12 Swiss Francs. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> <h2>Pizzeria Calabria - 3 Fratelli Scalea</h2> Rate: 7/10. Address: Quai du Cheval-Blanc 23, 1227 Geneva. </p>  
        <p> This is one of the biggest pizzas you can find in Geneva. The smallest size is between 35 cm and 40 cm diamter. Pizza is good, but not extraordinary I would say. I had it twice, and both times was good, but also particularly salty.
            I don't know .. it could deserve another chance. Prices for a take-away pizza start from 16.- of a Margherita (early 2022). </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> <h2>Chez Renato</h2>Rate: 8/10. Address: Rte de Saint-Julien 282, 1258 Perly-Certoux. </p>
        <p> Chez Renato is run by italians, coming from Sicily. I would advice anyone in the area to try their pizza (not worth maybe to go there from Geneva city tho). I have very good memories about it. However, I don't remember their prices. </p>

     <h1> Milan area </h1>
        <p> <h2>La Terrazza</h2>Rate: 8/10. Address: Via L. Tolstoi, 79, 20098 San Giuliano Milanese. </p>
        <p> Not an extremely good looking restaurant, but sometimes appearances can be deceptive. Pizza here is awesome, and very big! Calzone is very good, Margherita is very good, as well Pepperoni. If you are an hardcore pizza lover there is the <em>Spaccanapoli</em> pizza.
          It's a white pizza with sausage and friarielli, with the crust stuffed with cheese. Alert: take your time, it's very difficult to finish this pizza. 
          Prices are good, this is not an expensive place. </p>
